# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a GitHub Pages hosted project for displaying Gemini-generated deep research reports as interactive HTML dashboards. The repository contains:

- **Interactive Research Reports**: Comprehensive comparison dashboards generated by Gemini AI
- **GitHub Pages Deployment**: Static hosting via GitHub Pages
- **Landing Page**: Index page that serves as a directory for all hosted reports
- **No Build System**: Pure HTML/CSS/JS with CDN dependencies for easy deployment

## Architecture

The project follows a simple static website structure optimized for GitHub Pages:

- `index.html` - Landing page that serves as a directory for all research reports
- Yearly directories (e.g., `2025/`) containing Gemini-generated research reports
- Each report is a self-contained HTML file with embedded data and interactive features

### Gemini Report Structure

Each Gemini-generated report follows a consistent interactive dashboard pattern:
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript with Tailwind CSS (via CDN)
- **Visualization**: Chart.js for interactive data visualization
- **Data**: Embedded JavaScript objects containing comprehensive research data
- **Interactivity**: Advanced filtering, sorting, modal overlays, and persona-based recommendations
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach using Tailwind utilities

### Key Technologies Used

- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework loaded via CDN
- **Chart.js**: Data visualization library for interactive charts
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No frameworks, pure DOM manipulation
- **Inter Font**: Google Fonts for typography

## Development Workflow

### Adding New Reports
1. Generate research report using Gemini AI
2. Create interactive HTML dashboard based on the research
3. Place in appropriate yearly directory (e.g., `2025/`)
4. Update `index.html` to include links to new report
5. Commit and push - GitHub Pages will automatically deploy

### Report Standards
- **Self-Contained**: Each report must be a single HTML file with all dependencies via CDN
- **Responsive**: Must work well on mobile and desktop
- **Interactive**: Should include filtering, sorting, and detailed modal views
- **Data-Rich**: Embed comprehensive data as JavaScript objects
- **Accessible**: Use semantic HTML and proper ARIA labels

## GitHub Pages Deployment

- **Automatic**: Pushes to main branch automatically deploy to GitHub Pages
- **No Build Process**: Static files are served directly
- **Custom Domain**: Can be configured via repository settings
- **HTTPS**: Automatically enabled via GitHub Pages

## Working with Reports

When editing existing reports or creating new ones:
- Maintain the CDN-based dependency approach (no npm/build tools)
- Keep data embedding pattern for easy maintenance
- Follow existing interactive patterns for consistency
- Test responsiveness across device sizes
- Ensure all reports are linked from the main index.html
